          <p>
            Individuals may find themselves in the need to reserve a table at a
            restaurant for various reasons, including social gatherings with
            friends, business dinners, or routine breaks. <br />
            The desire is often to streamline the booking process, enabling
            swift reservations while also gaining quick access to the
            restaurant's menu. <br />
            This ensures not only a seamless booking experience but also
            provides the convenience of perusing available menu options in
            advance, catering to preferences for specific types of cuisine.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            In conducting a thorough review of articles pertaining to restaurant
            reservations, prompted by a scarcity of experience in this domain
            and the absence of such services within the country, I endeavored to
            cultivate a comprehensive understanding of the user demographic by
            constructing empathy maps. <br />
            The primary user cohort discerned through meticulous research
            comprised working professionals who dine at restaurants twice a day.
            While this group affirmed initial hypotheses about the preferences
            of FODIS APP customers, the research also brought to light that user
            constraints extended beyond a mere desire for ease of use. <br />
            Additional challenges surfaced, notably the time-consuming nature of
            traditional booking methods involving phone calls or email
            exchanges.

          <p>
            Investing time in sketching multiple iterations of each app screen
            on paper was a strategic step aimed at ensuring that the elements
            eventually incorporated into the digital wireframes would
            effectively address user pain points. <br />
            In the conceptualization of the home screen, my emphasis was on
            presenting a user-friendly list of restaurants, a deliberate choice
            aimed at optimizing user time. Prior to commencing the formal design
            phase, the wireframe served as a foundational tool, providing a
            preliminary visualization of the overall design direction.

                I undertook the task of crafting an application that enables
                users to effortlessly and swiftly reserve tables.<br />This
                endeavor was facilitated by the intentional design of screens,
                wherein users are presented with a curated list of options from
                which to choose. <br />
                Additionally, I incorporated a search functionality to empower
                users in locating a specific place swiftly and with ease.

                Facilitating the sharing of reservation details with friends,
                particularly in scenarios involving multiple individuals, was
                addressed by assigning the user responsible for the reservation
                and incorporating a streamlined solution. <br />
                To achieve this, I implemented a user-friendly share button,
                enabling the reservation initiator to send notifications
                containing the pertinent details to the involved parties
                efficiently.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          Commencing my first UX/UI project posed initial challenges due to a
          lack of concrete information. To address this, I conducted a
          comprehensive competitive audit as the foundation for primary
          research. <br />
          This experience underscored the understanding that initial app
          concepts represent just the starting point in the design process.
          Subsequent iterations were informed by usability studies and valuable
          feedback from peers. <br />
          Throughout the process, I had the opportunity to explore and
          experiment with various features within the Figma design tool.
